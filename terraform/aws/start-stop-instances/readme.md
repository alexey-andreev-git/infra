# Start and Stop Instances by Event using Amazon Lambda

This solution leverages AWS Lambda to start and stop EC2 instances based on specific events. By utilizing Amazon CloudWatch Events, you can schedule Lambda functions to manage the state of your instances, optimizing costs and ensuring resources are available when needed.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create IAM Role**: Set up an IAM role with the necessary permissions for Lambda to start and stop EC2 instances.
2. **Develop Lambda Function**: Write the Lambda function code to start and stop instances. This can be done using Python, Node.js, or any other supported language.
3. **Set Up CloudWatch Events**: Create CloudWatch Events rules to trigger the Lambda function at specified times or based on specific events.
4. **Deploy Lambda Function**: Deploy the Lambda function using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform.
5. **Test and Monitor**: Test the solution to ensure it works as expected and monitor the execution using CloudWatch Logs.

By following these steps, you can automate the management of your EC2 instances, reducing manual intervention and optimizing resource usage.
